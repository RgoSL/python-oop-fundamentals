# <img src="https://github.com/RgoSL/python-oop-fundamentals/blob/main/Logo.png" alt="Python OOP Logo" width="50px" /> Python: Applying Object-Oriented Programming
> This repository was created to store the practical exercises and implementations developed during Python Object-Oriented Programming courses on the **Alura** platform.

> The focus of this project is to consolidate core OOP concepts in Python through hands-on practice, progressing from basic class definitions to more structured and reusable designs inspired by real-world scenarios.

### 🧠 Topics Covered

> The following concepts are explored and applied:

- Understanding the importance of **Object-Oriented Programming** in Python  
- Designing **classes and attributes** inspired by real-world projects  
- Using **constructors** to initialize objects and define their initial state  
- Implementing **properties** to add logic beyond simple attribute access  
- Working with **static methods** and class-level behavior  

---

### 🎯 Objective

- This repository is part of my continuous learning process in Python.

- It also serves as a reference for future projects that require clean domain modeling and application structure.
